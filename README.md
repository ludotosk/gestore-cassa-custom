## How does the automated connection work?
Unfortunately, the javascript application can see only the IP address and not the mac address, so I used Evilscan to search all the clients in the local network, and then I read the header to see whether or not is the webserver of the cash registry. In case of failure of this process, the operator is able to insert the IP of the cash registry manually.
### Is safe the usage of this method?
After the server establishes the connection with the cash registry the cash registry notifies the connection so it's safe.
### What happens if someone tries to do a man-in-the-middle attack?
I can't prevent this issue because the connection between the cash registry and the server isn't encrypted. So it is not in my capability.
## Local database
Even if the cash registry saves all the data in its database with mine I'm able to perform analysis and there is also room for feature improvements in the future.
### Why I don't use the product database of the registry?
I made this choice because it is easier to add items to the server than add in the registry, and I want to make it possible to perform less operations in the registry as possible.
## How did I implement cryptography over HTTP?
I expose an HTTP page with an RSA 4096 bit key that the client reads, then the client sends an encrypted message to the server with an aes256 key that is then used in the rest of the communication. After the key exchange, I encrypt all the data in the body of the HTTP message. So the AES key is generated for each communication, while the RSA key is generated by the server at the first boot.
## How does the authentication work?
In order to authenticate, the client uses one 4 digit code that the server print in the home directory, after the client makes the authentication the server make on a json web token that is necessary for each communication with the server. I decided to print the code in the home directory because if the server is running on the same computer as the client the user can read it, but the true reason why I chose a code is that you can run this server on raspberry with a 16 chars screen.
## How it is possible to have such a light server?
Thanks to Vue I'm able to client side render the web interface, for the database instead I have chosen SQLite. So the server works only to send and receive data from the client and to send static assets like HTML, CSS etc.
